# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PrimeVue Theme Designer is a visual tool that allows developers to customize PrimeVue 4 themes through an intuitive interface without needing deep knowledge of the PrimeVue token system. The tool provides real-time preview, simplified settings management, and theme export/import capabilities, making it easy to create and maintain consistent design systems across projects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access a visual theme designer interface, so that I can customize PrimeVue themes without learning the complex token system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to `/theme` THEN the system SHALL display a theme designer page with preview area on the left and settings drawer on the right
2. WHEN I open the theme designer THEN the system SHALL show existing UI components in the preview area
3. WHEN I interact with the settings drawer THEN the system SHALL provide an intuitive interface for theme customization
4. WHEN I make changes THEN the system SHALL show a draft preview without applying changes to the main application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to modify theme settings through simplified controls, so that I can customize colors, typography, and spacing without dealing with raw tokens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access theme settings THEN the system SHALL group settings by categories (Colors, Typography, Spacing, Components)
2. WHEN I modify a setting THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate input controls (color picker, unit input, slider, select)
3. WHEN I enter values THEN the system SHALL support multiple units (px, rem, em, %) with validation
4. WHEN I make invalid entries THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent invalid values
5. WHEN I modify settings THEN the system SHALL show changes in real-time preview without affecting the main application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage color palettes easily, so that I can create consistent color schemes across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access color settings THEN the system SHALL provide primary and surface palette customization
2. WHEN I select a color THEN the system SHALL automatically generate appropriate color variations (50, 100, 200, etc.)
3. WHEN I choose colors THEN the system SHALL support both predefined palettes and custom color selection
4. WHEN I change colors THEN the system SHALL update all related components in the preview
5. WHEN I work with colors THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark theme modes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize individual components and component groups, so that I can fine-tune the appearance of specific UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access component settings THEN the system SHALL organize components into logical groups (Forms, Navigation, Feedback)
2. WHEN I select a component group THEN the system SHALL show relevant settings for all components in that group
3. WHEN I select an individual component THEN the system SHALL provide specific customization options for that component
4. WHEN I modify component settings THEN the system SHALL automatically map changes to appropriate PrimeVue tokens
5. WHEN I change component settings THEN the system SHALL show the affected components in the preview area

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to apply, reset, and manage my theme changes, so that I can control when customizations take effect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make changes THEN the system SHALL maintain them in a draft state until explicitly applied
2. WHEN I click "Apply" THEN the system SHALL apply all draft changes to the active theme
3. WHEN I click "Reset" THEN the system SHALL discard all unapplied changes and revert to the last applied state
4. WHEN I have unapplied changes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which settings have been modified
5. WHEN I apply changes THEN the system SHALL update the PrimeVue theme using official APIs (updatePreset, updatePrimaryPalette, updateSurfacePalette)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export and import themes, so that I can share themes between projects and save custom configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Export" THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON file containing all theme settings
2. WHEN I import a theme file THEN the system SHALL validate the format and apply the settings
3. WHEN I save themes THEN the system SHALL persist them in localStorage for future sessions
4. WHEN I access the theme designer THEN the system SHALL provide predefined themes (Default, Dark, Corporate)
5. WHEN I switch between presets THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate theme configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme designer to be modular and portable, so that I can easily integrate it into different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I integrate the theme designer THEN the system SHALL be contained within a single `src/theme-designer/` directory
2. WHEN I add the theme designer to a project THEN the system SHALL require minimal configuration and dependencies
3. WHEN I use the theme designer THEN the system SHALL not interfere with existing application functionality
4. WHEN I build the application THEN the system SHALL support lazy loading to minimize impact on main bundle size
5. WHEN I extend the theme designer THEN the system SHALL provide clear APIs for adding new setting types and components

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme designer to integrate seamlessly with existing Vue 3 and PrimeVue setup, so that it works with my current development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the theme designer THEN the system SHALL work with Vue 3 Composition API and script setup syntax
2. WHEN I integrate the theme designer THEN the system SHALL support the existing auto-import configuration
3. WHEN I use the theme designer THEN the system SHALL be compatible with PrimeVue 4.x and Tailwind 4.x
4. WHEN I develop with the theme designer THEN the system SHALL follow the project's existing code patterns and conventions
5. WHEN I build the project THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing Vite build configuration
